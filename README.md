## Project Overview
This analysis provides insights on the product performance and Users' reviews and Insights on the product Purchased. 
Amazon is one of the world’s leading e-commerce platforms, serving millions of customers globally across various product categories such as electronics, home and kitchen, personal care, and more. 
Known for its customer-centric approach, Amazon collects vast amounts of data daily through customer interactions, product sales, and reviews.

This project analyzes a subset of Amazon product and customer review data to uncover insights related to product performance, pricing strategies, customer engagement, and revenue opportunities.
The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, incorporating pivot tables, calculated columns, and dynamic slicers to design an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.

The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights that can guide business decisions related to pricing, marketing, and inventory management.
This Excel-based project analyzes Amazon product listings by exploring:
- Ratings
- Number of Reviews
- Discounts
- Revenue Potential

The dashboard helps identify the most valuable products and customer perceptions using pivot tables, slicers, calculated columns, and engaging visuals.

##  Key Insights & Recommendations
1. **Insight**: Electronics dominate potential revenue, with over ₹87M, far ahead of any other category.

   **Recommendation**: Amazon should prioritize inventory, advertising, and promotional efforts for Electronics to maximize returns.

2. **Insight**: Some products with heavy discounts are still underperforming.  
   **Recommendation**: Investigate product value and listing quality — discount alone doesn't drive sales.

3. **Insight**: Revenue potential is influenced more by review count than star rating.  
   **Recommendation**: Encourage verified reviews for high-potential products through follow-up emails or incentives.

4. **Insight**: Low-rated products had fewer reviews and lower discounts.  
   **Recommendation**: Consider repackaging or relisting to improve visibility and engagement.

5. **Insight**: Electronics tend to dominate in high ratings but not always in sales volume.  
   **Recommendation**: Diversify promotions beyond electronics to discover hidden winners.

## Challenges 
Data Cleaning was quite difficult and challenging due to longproduct names which could negatively impact visualization and there were outiers that was quite challenging to find.
